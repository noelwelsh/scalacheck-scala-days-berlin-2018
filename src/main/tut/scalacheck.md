# Anatomy of ScalaCheck

Now that we have some practice describing properties, let's see how we
encode and run them using ScalaCheck.

## Properties: Asserting Invariants

For the example of the *invertibility* of addition--for every `x` there is an
integer `-x` such that `x + -x = 0`--we are expressing a *universally
quantified* property: the assertion should be true for *all*
`Int` values.

In ScalaCheck, we express universally quantified properties with the
`Prop.forAll` method:

```tut:silent:book
import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll

val invertability = forAll { (x: Int) => x + -x == 0 }
```

(We often `import` the `Prop.forAll` method directly into scope, for brevity.)

The function `forAll` is a higher-order function that transforms another
function that makes an assertion into a `Prop`, ScalaCheck's representation of
a property. Here we passed an anonymous function that takes an `Int` named
`x`, and it asserts that adding `x` to its inverse should always equal zero.

Let's reformat and annotate the expression to highlight its parts:

```tut:silent:book
val invertability =     // the property
  forAll { (x: Int) =>  // universal quantification over a type
    x + -x == 0         // the assertion
  }
```

Let's test our property:

```tut:book
import org.scalacheck._

Test.check(Test.Parameters.default, invertability)
```

(You can use `Test.check` in the console; later we will detail the usual practice
of running the property tests via `sbt`)

You probably saw output similar to

```scala
// res0: org.scalacheck.Test.Result = Result(Passed,100,0,Map(),101)
```

The `Result` represents the result of ScalaCheck running the test. The first
field, with value `Passed`, tells us that the test passed. The next parameter,
`100`, is interesting. This tells us how many test cases ScalaCheck generated
for us. A third field, `0`, is the number of test cases that were generated but
discarded because they didn't meet a precondition. Being zero it indicates that
no cases were discarded. Complex preconditions can cause many cases to be
discarded, which in turn can lead to test cases that take a long time to run or
ScalaCheck giving up on generating cases. The final two fields are not
particularly important for our situation.


## Generators: Producing Values to Test

When we create a `Prop` using `forAll`, we give it our function that
asserts the invariant on its input. Where does this input value come from?
These inputs come from *generators*, named `Gen` in ScalaCheck:

```scala
// (edited for brevity)
sealed abstract class Gen[+T] {
  def sample: Option[T]
}
```

At its heart, `Gen` produces sample values of a given type. The result of
`sample` is an `Option[T]` because, as we've just seen above, the generator may
fail to generate a sample.


ScalaCheck comes with many, many generators out-of-the-box, which you'll find on
the `Gen` companion object.

```tut:silent:book
Gen.alphaStr    // `String` values like "abc", etc.
Gen.numStr      // numeric `String` values: "123", etc.
Gen.posNum[Int] // positive numbers: 42, etc.
Gen.const(1)    // always generates the given value

Gen.choose(0, 9)         // pick any number in a range, inclusive
Gen.oneOf('a', 'b', 'c') // pick any of these values
```

There are many more.

Let's `sample` some values from these generators:

```tut:book:silent
// A useful utility to generate samples from a Gen
def sample[A](n: Int)(gen: Gen[A]): List[Option[A]] =
  List.fill(n)(gen.sample)
```

```tut:book
sample(3)(Gen.alphaStr)
sample(3)(Gen.numStr)
sample(3)(Gen.posNum[Int])
sample(3)(Gen.const(1))
sample(3)(Gen.choose(0, 9))
sample(3)(Gen.oneOf('a', 'b', 'c'))
```

## Generator combinators

There are many ways to combine generators to create new ones.

Generators are monads, meaning they have `map` and `flatMap` methods.
(`Gen.const` is the `pure` method that rounds out the monad interface.) We can
use these in the usual way to transform generators.


For example, we can generate the even positive integers by `mapping` the
positive integers.

```tut:book:
// Generate even positive integers
sample(3)(Gen.posNum[Int].map(x => x * 2))
```

With `flatMap` we can do more complicated transforms, such as using our input to
choose a generator.


```tut:book:
sample(3)(Gen.choose(0,2).flatMap{ 
  case 0 => Gen.alphaStr
  case 1 => Gen.numStr
  case _ => Gen.const("Hi!")
})
```

These kind of switching is so common that ScalaCheck provides a number of
combinators to make it easy. We've already seen `oneOf` above. It also works
with generators, so we could have also written

```tut:book:
sample(3)(Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaStr, Gen.numStr, Gen.const("Hi!")))
```

Using `oneOf` each generator is chosen with equal probability. For more
complicated choices we can use `frequency`, where we give each generator a
weight. Generators are chosen in proportion to their weight.

```tut:book
// generate a 'b' twice as much as an 'a', a 'c' three times as much
sample(3)(Gen.frequency(1 -> 'a', 2 -> 'b', 3 -> 'c'))
```

Another common use case is to generate a container of a certain size. The
`containerOf` and `containerOfN` methods do this.

```tut:book:
// generate a container whose elements come from another `Gen`
List.fill(3)(Gen.containerOf[List, Int](Gen.oneOf(1, 3, 5)).sample)

// generate a fixed-size container whose elements come from another `Gen`
List.fill(3)(Gen.containerOfN[Seq, String](3, Gen.alphaStr).sample)
```


## Expressing Preconditions

The final methods on `Gen` that we will look at are those for expressing
preconditions. The main method is `suchThat`, or it's direct synonym
`filter`.

Above we expressed even positive integers as

```tut:book:
// Generate even positive integers
sample(3)(Gen.posNum[Int].map(x => x * 2))
```

We could alternatively express it as

```tut:silent:book:
sample(3)(Gen.posNum[Int].suchThat(_ % 2 == 0))
// The exact equivalent using filter
sample(3)(Gen.posNum[Int].filter(_ % 2 == 0))
```

What's the difference between the two? Think about this before you read on.

The first way of defining the even positive integers suffers from overflow, and can end up generating negative numbers! The second ends up filtering out half of the numbers generated from `Gen.psNum`, so it is less efficient (though correct!)



### Exercises

Now we've explored the basics of `Gen`, it's time for you to get some practice using the API.

#### Finger Exercisess

These exercises are all about learning to use the API effectively.

- Generate a `String` of lowercase alphabetic characters
- Generate a `String` of numeric characters
- Generate integers between 100 and 200, inclusive
- Generate strings that start with one of "a", "b", or "c"
- Generate odd integers
- Generate a list of between 3 and 5 positive integers

#### More Complicated Situations

Create a `Gen[User]`, where `User` is

```tut:silent:book:
final case class User(name: String, age: Int, email: String)
```

Make justifiable decisions for the choice of generators for the fields.
